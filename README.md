# JourneyMap Party Helper
JourneyMap Party Helper is a utility designed to facilitate sharing waypoints with friends through in-game chat. It encodes the waypoints as binary data within UTF-8 characters for efficient transmission.

Although the project remains unfinished and unpolished, there is less motivation to continue it, as [JourneyMap Legacy](https://github.com/TeamJM/journeymap-legacy) now exists as an open source project on GitHub.

## Wishlist for V2
-   Integration with the Better Questing Mod, allowing for seamless waypoint sharing within questing groups.
-   Integration with FTB Teams functionality to streamline sharing waypoints among team members.
